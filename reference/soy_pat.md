# Soybean PAT real data set

This dataset belongs to the Soybean Pan-African Trials (PAT) which
evaluate 65 soybean genotypes across 19 environments (Araújo et al.
2025). It contains the empirical best linear unbiased estimates of
genotypic means of grain yield (GY), plant height (PH) and number of
days to maturity (NDM) from 65 experimental genotypes evaluated in 19
locations.
